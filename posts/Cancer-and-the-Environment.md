**Introduction**

Did you know each year, [parents of 15,000 children 0-19 in the U.S., will hear &quot;your child has cancer.&quot; It
remains the #1 cause of death by disease in children. In the last 40 years, the survival rate for childhood cancer
has increased, but for rare cancers, survival rates still remain low](https://curesearch.org/childhood-cancer-statistics) . It is thought that different forms of cancer
have different causes. [According to scientists at the National Cancer Institute, risk factors include family
history, specific genetic syndromes, high levels of radiation, and certain pharmaceutical agents used in
chemotherapy . Cancer incidence rates in children have stabilized since 2015, after increasing since 1975 . Over
the past 40 years, leukemia in children has increased 35%](https://www.epa.gov/americaschildrenenvironment/health-childhood-cancer). Do our children today have cancer from
environmental pollution?

Environmental contaminants can play a role in childhood cancers, with the majority focused on pesticides and
solvents. [According to the President’s Cancer Panel, “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has
been grossly underestimated](https://www.epa.gov/americaschildrenenvironment/health-childhood-cancer).” The World Health Organization (2013) declared air pollution can cause cancer.

[In 2024, two million adults will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States with breast cancer and prostate
cancer most common](https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/common.html). Cancer can come from the land, water, or air through exposure to environmental
carcinogens, which are substances that can damage DNA and cause cancer when inhaled, ingested, or absorbed
through the skin. Carcinogens may include chemicals like asbestos, arsenic, benzene, and certain air pollutants.
We’ve known cancer and the environment are interrelated since Rachelle Carson&#39;s book “Silent Spring” (1962)
who discussed cancer as a potential consequence of exposure to pesticides.

ISGlobal Barcelona Institute of Global Health reported that 90% of cancer cases are caused by the environment,
while [Super Polluters](https://features.weather.com/superpolluters/) presented how greenhouse gases and toxic compounds released from coal burning fire
plants within 30 miles of Evansville, Indiana affect people’s health. PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid) or “forever
chemicals” have been found in major rivers (like the Ohio River) which may act as water reservoirs for many
cities and towns. [These chemicals are man-made and have been linked to cancer, immune system problems, and
developmental issues in children](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/study-finds-toxic-pfas-throughout-the-ohio-river). In addition, [the release of microplastics (less than 5 millimeters), and
nanoplastics (less than 1 micrometer) into our bodies has caused for much concern](https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere).

## What Can You Do?

**(1) To reduce your chances of getting cancer, the Mayo Clinic recommends you to:**
1. Not use tobacco 
2. Eat healthy foods 
3. Stay at a healthy weight and be physically active 
4. Protect yourself from the sun
5. Get vaccinated
6. Stay away from risky behaviors

   of Philadelphia, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Texas Children’s Hospital, Lucile
   Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford, Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital, Riley’s Children’s
   Hospital, National Children’s Cancer Society, St. Baldrick’s Foundation, American Cancer Society or
   others. There are many children&#39;s hospitals in the world, including 270 in the United States.
