**Introduction**

Have you ever thought why it is necessary that the winter season be so cold, and why some people are taking
steps to protect it? [The Climate Reality Project has studied](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/we-need-winter) 
why we need winter, and Protect Our Winters (POW) is actively trying to protect it.

Winter is so important for plants and animals to rest or go into dormancy which is an important part of their
normal life cycle. But with climate change, we’re experiencing winters that are warmer and shorter affecting so
many aspects of life as reported by POW. So what does all of this mean?

If the ground or air isn’t cold enough for a sufficient amount of time in winter, science writer David Cox
(British Broadcasting Corporation, September 26, 2024) reported [a warmer and sicker world could result with
mosquitoes carrying deadly diseases across the United States](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240925-why-mosquitoes-are-thriving-in-a-warmer-world). In his report, he said, “West Nile virus, Eastern equine
encephalitis, malaria, and dengue are gaining new ground in the United States. The mosquitoes that carry these
diseases are thriving in a warming world.”

[Sadie Ryan found that warmer temperatures have led to extended mosquito breeding periods, and a corresponding
increase in disease outbreaks transmitted by the insects](https://epi.ufl.edu/2019/03/29/climate-change-will-expose-more-people-to-mosquito-borne-diseases/) associated with climate change. “An Aedes mosquito can lay
200 eggs in a coke bottle cap. That&#39;s why you should worry about little bits of trash with a bit of water building up in
them,” says Sadie Ryan. In 2021, Stanford pediatrician and arbovirologist Desiree LaBeaud and her colleagues
launched the nonprofit organization HERI-Kenya to reduce [the spread of mosquito-borne diseases in Kenya by
cleaning up the plastic waste where the insect breed](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2022/02/investigating-mosquito-borne-diseases-led-unlikely-culprit-plastic-trash).

With warming temperatures, climate change increases the frequency and intensity of flooding which causes an
increase in breeding habitat for mosquitoes. So too does humidity, urbanization, and movement of people around the
world spread mosquito populations. Winter doesn&#39;t kill all mosquitoes, but it does cause some to become inactive
or die. Quiescence occurs in some adult mosquitoes in winter when adult populations die, but eggs remain
dormant until they’re activated by warming temperatures.

In winter, snow and ice are very important too. With both, there is more solar radiation reflected from the Earth,
and they both give valuable water for drinking purposes. Continental and alpine glaciers are today melting
causing the sea level to rise and the permafrost to melt. Winter is needed to maintain glaciers, permafrost,
streams, and [springs that can flow year-round, regardless of plunging temperatures and thick ice on streams](https://northernwoodlands.org/outside_story/article/springs-in-winter).

POW, founded by the legendary American snowboarder Jeremy Jones, speaks about how the last two years has
averaged the warmest in history. His youtube film Purple Mountains speaks about the [benefits from snow and
ice in the winter](https://protectourwinters.org/purple-mountains-film/). The main theme of POW is to mobilize outdoor enthusiasts to advocate for climate change
policies that protect places and experiences they love, like skiing, snowboarding, and ice fishing. They want to
use their passion for outdoor activities to drive climate action by way of outdoor recreation, policy advocacy,
athletes leading the movement, and community building processes.
