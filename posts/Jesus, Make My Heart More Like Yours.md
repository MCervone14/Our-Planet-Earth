**Introduction**

Who prayed, “Jesus, make my heart more like yours?” It was the grandmother of Jorge Mario Bergoglio (later
known as Pope Francis), who taught him this 7-word prayer. The pope died Monday (April 21, 2025) from what
the Vatican said, “was a cerebral stroke and heart failure.” He was 88 years old, and was pope since 2013 for
1.4 billion Roman Catholics. It is the opinion of *Our Planet Earth* that Pope Francis will be recognized as a
saint in the Catholic Church. Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, OSA, was elected as Pope Leo XIV on May 8.

Since Pope Francis’ death, there have been [countless testimonies](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/pope-francis-dies-age-88-reaction/) from leaders throughout the world about him
as a man and pope, characterizing him as a pastoral, humble, loving, caring, and devoted shepherd to all God’s
children. Eva Fernández, Spanish journalist and author of “El Papa de la Ternura” (“The Pope of Tenderness”),
told Our Sunday Visitor News that his actions, whether helping survivors of sex trafficking or comforting
prisoners, exemplified his belief in “a revolution of tenderness,” showing a radically compassionate response to
human suffering. Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Leader, highlighted Pope Francis’ dedication to serving the
marginalized, his embodiment of Christian values, and his significant impact on the world.

*Our Planet Earth* was first established in 2020 to give support to Pope Francis and
his Encyclical Letter entitled *On Care for our Common Home, ‘Laudao Si’*. Our articles discuss issues about
our planet, and what we can do better to keep the air, water, and land clean. Knowing how Pope Francis was an
advocate of taking care of the poor, needy, and those less fortunate, we’ve offered many considerations for
humankind, especially since global warming is making clear, climate change has much to do with major
flooding, droughts, wildfires, medical illnesses, and loss of so many important ecosystems like the arctic ice
fields, permafrost, coral reefs, mangrove swamps, tropical forests and degradation of the oceans. Because of
these issues, many cities are developing Climate Action Plans which is good, but maybe in addition, we should
promote plans for living simpler lives, consuming only what we need, and working on **climate repair** methods?

Pope Francis’ legacy is multifaceted, but in *Laudato Si’* and *Laudato Deum*, he focused on how man’s activities
throughout the world have degraded environments causing many people, especially those poor, to migrate from
their homes, e.g., sea level rise has inundated many island communities, forcing evacuations. What will the
United States do when the eastern seaboard is inundated which is happening now in Miami, Florida? How can
we address the many issues that have happened, and are happening now throughout the world? History tells us
that we need to believe what scientists are telling us, and enforce regulations for compliance similar to the many
laws that were enacted in the 1970’s and 1980’s.

The cause for our current dilemma is scientifically well-known, and transitioning to renewable fuels along with
capturing greenhouse gases will help immensely. A model to follow may be the **1987 Montreal Protocol**. It
was a landmark international agreement aimed at protecting the Earth&#39;s ozone layer by phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODS) like chlorofluorocarbons. It is considered one of the most successful environmental
agreements, with nearly 200 countries ratifying it. The Protocol also has significant climate benefits, since many
ODSs are also powerful greenhouse gases.

**What Can You Do?**

1. Promote sustainability methods which will help keep the air, water, and land clean.
2. Encourage governments to accept ways of protecting countries from war, famine, and damaging the planet.
3. Pass strict ordinances to allow for environmentally friendly ways of addressing issues throughout the
   world.
4. Elect only representatives that will truly serve you and who direct their focus on what you love.
5. Understand there’s a “tipping point” of no return. We do not want our children to suffer from our mistakes.
