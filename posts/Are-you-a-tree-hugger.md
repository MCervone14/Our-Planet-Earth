**Introduction**

Are you a tree hugger? We hope so, but many people joke about hugging a tree. Those who make fun, act as if
it is a bad thing to care for the planet. Don’t people know how important trees are and what they do for us, or do
some people believe trees are inconsequential, dead, and do nothing? We certainly hope not! Hugging a tree is
especially appropriate this Spring during Earth Day on April 22, 2025, when trees are turning green once again.

Trees weather many storms and work hard to provide essential qualities of life for humans on Earth. Some of
these benefits are their: (1) beauty in shapes, sizes, and unique qualities; (2) woodland values for humans (e.g.,
building materials) and in many interconnected relationships within the forest; (3) wildlife values in food
production for so many people and animals; (4) heritage values in keeping trees a part of our family history
(e.g., the American Chestnut); (5) landscape values for our urban, suburban, and rural properties; (5) recreation,
enjoyment, and education for hikers, photographers, and birders; (6) colors, smells, and sounds as different from
each season; (7) protection of properties from wind, sleet, rain, and snow; (8) protection of soil and wind
erosion, including water run-off; (9) use as homes for many animals, plants, and fungi; (10) ability to generate
oxygen given to the atmosphere for humans to breathe; (11) absorption of carbon dioxide, a heat-absorbing
molecule, from the atmosphere that helps cool the planet; and (12) important medicinal values.

A British Broadcasting Corporation Earth publication and our YouTube video at the end of this article entitled
Why you should hug a street tree give great information, such as, “trees filter air pollution, protect against
floods, cools air, and provides habitat for birds and insects.” These trees also, through the process of
transpiration, release water vapor from their leaves into the atmosphere that enters into the water cycle creating
clouds and rain elsewhere and locally. In addition, trees provide shade that lowers temperatures, especially
during hot days. By doing so, they can reduce a “heat island” effect in cities.

[WordForest gives the following “Therapeutic benefits of hugging trees: A true nature’s embrace:”](https://www.wordforest.org/2024/03/19/tatkaw2024-2/)
1. gives a nature connection,
2. provides an emotional release that calms you,
3. shows an inner calm to thank and express gratitude for benefits,
4. gives a self-reflection on how you feel about yourself and where you are in nature,
5. reduces stress that decreases stress hormone levels,
6. gives an immune boost where you absorb or breathe in phytoncides that protect you from disease,
7. creates an improved mood which reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety,
8. lowers your blood pressure, and
9. enhances creativity and cognitive function that helps you in your overall well-being.
   This same reference also stated: “By embracing trees, we embrace a healthier, more harmonious future for
   ourselves and the planet we call home.”
  
## What Can You Do?
1. Give trees on your property a name, and measure their diameter at breast height. Value them.
2. Promote a diversity of trees planted in cities, towns, and parks. No monocultures.
3. Plant new trees on your property and in other places, as permitted by existing ordinances.
4. Save old, big trees unless they pose a threat to home or safety.
5. Enjoy walks through forests that have old growth trees.
6. Encourage the creation and protection of properties that have trees, such as National Wildlife Refuges,
   National Forests, Nature Preserves, State Preserves, city and local parks, and mitigation sites, in perpetuity.

**Quote:** 
>“Across the centuries and throughout the world, the existence of trees has been threatened in the name
of progress, to pad the pockets of the greedy, or, sadly, out of sheer ignorance, yet the original tree
huggers continue to influence environmentalist efforts. Those Indigenous to the land see clearly that their
existence is connected to the survival of trees. We can follow in their footsteps by recognizing our connection
with and responsibility to the earth, which is so in need of our aid.” Being Benedictine, Jodi Blazek Gehr,
Oblate of St. Benedict in Tree Huggers: The Circle of Care.”
