**Introduction**

What does “Care for Our Common Home” mean to you? We know if we don’t care for things, they may go
away or be changed from what we consider normal. Is this what has happened to our precious planet? Even
back during the time of St. Bonaventure and St. Francis of Assisi in the 13th century, Care for Our Common
Home was important. In the 17th century, St. Kateri Tekakwitha believed in Care for Our Common Home too. Both are our “patron saints” of the environment and ecology.

In the 20th century, St. Pope John Paul II addressed the concept of &quot;Care for Creation&quot; for more than 27
years. He consistently spoke about the relationship between humanity, the environment, and God&#39;s creation. [A
key message of his was “humanity has a responsibility to care for the Earth, as it is a gift from God.”](https://laudatosimovement.org/news/pope-john-paul-ii-caring-creation/) Later
came, Pope Benedict XVI (affectionately known as the green pope) and Pope Francis (author of *Laudato Si’*)
focused too on the environment. Let’s pray to Jesus, Mary, Joseph, saints, Pope Leo XIV, and elected officials
to heal our planet. We need them to understand the urgency of our prayers and for them to work together in
interceding for us. It is the right thing to do, especially with the Season of Creation September 1 to October 4.

Many articles report on how man has polluted the air, water, and land, and we know stories where pollution has
affected not only the planet but also the health of people. Medical authorities who keep track of diseases and
illnesses say, Climate Change will affect both our physical and mental health.

**When one searches for physical and mental illnesses related to climate change, one finds:**
1. Heat-related illnesses from heat stroke and exhaustion
2. Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases from ozone, wildfires, dust storms, and heat waves
3. Vector-borne diseases from disease-carrying insects and ticks, especially after floods
4. Chronic kidney diseases from heat stress
5. Injuries from heat-related incidents in the workplace
6. Climate anxiety and mental stress from worrying about the future, especially for breadwinners
7. Mental health disorders after extreme events such as natural disasters causing depression, anxiety, and PTSD
8. Increased suicide risk following droughts and associated economic losses
9. Decreased sperm production, quality, and count due to environmental pollutants related to climate change
10. Erectile dysfunction from air pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, and ozone

**What Can You Do?**

 [Thomas Motyka](https://www.acoi.org/blog/climate-change-and-patient-health-what-physicians-can-do), a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, says, “The evidence is clear: climate change already impacts human health in ways
 we can no longer ignore. Rising temperatures, fires, poor air quality, extreme weather events, and
 changing patterns of infectious diseases are just a few of the culprits wreaking havoc on public health.”
 So, what role can patients do about climate change challenges? His suggestions are:

1. Help patients understand how climate change impacts their health.
2. Educate at the least parents, asthmatic, and cardiac patients about climate change in the exam room.
3. Empower patients by encouraging them to take steps that benefit both their health and the planet.
4. Give guidance on plant diets, being physically active, and making changes at home for cost savings.
5. Medical doctors need to be role models by encouraging patients to make eco-friendly choices.
6. Doctors need to educate, inspire, and lead others in body, mind, spirit, and in the environment.

Dr. Margaret Chan, the former World Health Organization Director-General, said, **“Climate change is the
greatest global health threat of the 21st century.”** Many others agree with this prediction.
