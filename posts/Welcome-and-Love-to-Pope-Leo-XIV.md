*Introduction*

It is with great pleasure we welcome and show love for Pope Leo XIV. He was elected our new pope on May 8, 2025. It took the cardinals two days to decide on Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was the Prefect of the
Dicastery for Bishops in Rome, as our 267th pope. Prior to Pope Francis calling him to Rome on January 30,
2023, he spent years as a missionary and bishop in Peru. He’s our first Augustinian pope, first North American
pope, and second Roman Pontiff from the Americas. Pope Leo XIV speaks English, Spanish, Italian, French,
and Portuguese; reads Latin and German; and is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Peru. According to [MLB.com](https://www.mlb.com/news/pope-leo-xiv-spotted-wearing-white-sox-hat-at-vatican) , the
leader of the worldwide Catholic Church is &quot;the world&#39;s most famous White Sox fan.&quot;

Robert Prevost was born on September 14, 1955 in Chicago, Illinois and grew up in Dolton, Illinois. His
father was Louis Marius Prevost, and mother, Mildred Martinez. [Two of Mildred’s sisters were nuns](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a64716116/pope-leo-xiv-family-explained/). He has
two brothers, Louis Martin and John Joseph. [They grew up in a small house. He was an altar boy; sang in the
choir; and attended St. Mary of the Assumption School](https://ewtn.co.uk/article-visiting-pope-leo-xivs-chicago-how-the-south-side-shaped-americas-first-pontiff/). His father was an educator, superintendent, and
principal. His mother was a librarian. His father died in 1977; his mother in 1990. His two brothers are alive.

He attended [St. Augustine Seminary High School in Michigan](https://www.detroitcatholic.com/news/high-school-classmate-recalls-new-pope-as-smart-caring-and-humble-class-leader), a boarding school run by the Order of
St. Augustine. Emily Burack (Town and Country Magazine on May 8) reported in addition to St. Mary of the
Assumption and St. Augustine Seminary High School, he graduated from Villanova University in 1977 with a
B.S. in mathematics; received an Honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 2014; and was the first pope to
graduate from this Augustinian Catholic institution. In 1982, he received a Master’s of Divinity degree from
Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, and became a priest that year. In 1984 and 1987, he received a
Licentiate degree and Doctorate degree respectively in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas
Aquinas in Rome. St. Pope John Paul II graduated from this prestigious college too.

[Some believe Cardinal Robert Prevost took the papal name of Pope Leo XIV](https://www.lifeusa.org/post/welcoming-robert-francis-prevost-as-pope-leo-xiv) because of Pope Leo XIII
(1878-1903), who advocated for workers&#39; rights, and also because of his encyclical entitled “Rerum Novarum.”
This could suggest Pope Leo’s XIV’s commitment to social justice and a desire to continue the legacy of Pope
Leo XIII, and even possibly a desire for [continuity with the papacy of Pope Francis](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-pope-name-why-they-change/), who emphasized social
justice and a need to help the poor and marginalized. The name Leo has a long history in the Catholic Church,
with previous popes like Pope Leo I (called “Pope Leo the Great”) and Pope Leo IX playing significant roles
in church history. Pope Leo the Great (440-461 A.D.) persuaded Attila the Hun in 452 A.D. to not invade
Italy, and Pope Leo IX (1049-1054 A.D.) worked for the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches to
separate.

[In Pope Leo XIV’s inauguration mass on May 18, 2025](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-05/pope-leo-xiv-let-us-walk-towards-god-and-love-one-another.html), he offered to all brothers and sisters in the
church a unification and relational theme for reconciliation and communion. He called for “a united church －a
sign of unity and communion, which becomes a leaven for a reconciled world. He said, **&quot;I come to you as a
brother, who desires to be the servant of your faith and your joy, walking with you on the path of God’s
love, for he wants us all to be united into one family.”** Pope Leo XIV recalled how love and unity are the two
aspects of the mission entrusted to Peter by Jesus.

## **What Can You Do?**

1. Bishop Joseph Siegel asks “all Catholics in the Evansville Diocese and all people of good will to pray for
   Pope Leo XIV as he begins his petrine ministry, that the Holy Spirit may bless and guide him as he leads us
   in love to a deeper faith and hope in the risen Lord Jesus Christ” (The Message, Issue 5/16/2025, page 5).

2. Encourage governments to protect all countries of the world from war, famine, and damaging the planet.

3. Promote more participation in the Catholic Church and support greater welcoming and love for all people.

4. Increase registration in the Laudato Si’ Action Platform to help save the Earth’s many natural resources.

5. Show a willingness for cooperative efforts and actions to better care for all the people on Planet Earth.
