Our Planet Earth

**Author’s note:** _This website encourages, inspires, and informs citizens to act now, and to practice ecological principles in our journey “On Care for Our Common Home.”_

**Introduction**

Do you believe our planet is precious, and realize Earth is our only home? If so, we must be precious too including our ecosystems, plants, wildlife, land, water and air, which make our world extraordinarily splendid. Our feelings about who we are as a human race require that we approach nature with love, thankfulness, and dependency, and our intelligence forces us to change our way of life.

The [United Nations Development Program is committed to a positive environmental change through collective action](https://www.undp.org/blog/our-planet-precious), and gives seventeen sustainable goals, as listed below, that will transform our world.

1. No poverty
2. Zero hunger
3. Good health and well being
4. Quality education
5. Gender equality
6. Clean water and sanitation
7. Affordable and clean energy
8. Decent work and economic growth
9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure
10. Reduced inequalities
11. Sustainable cities and communities
12. Responsible consumption and production
13. Climate action
14. Life below water
15. Life on land
16. Peace, justice and strong institutions
17. Partnerships for these goals

Pope Francis in his encyclical letter **On Care for our Common Home**, _Laudato Si’_ offered similar thoughts that we as a human race need to be at peace with ourselves and others in achieving his desired seven Action Platform goals in addition to the United Nations goals above.

## What Can You Do?

There is so much you can do that **can make all the difference in the world**. First, you can be aware of what needs to be done, and take just one thing and make it your goal. Slowly over time you will master more steps you need to make a better world, e.g., maybe adjust your life style for a simpler way of living with fewer needs that in most cases, only add to more clutter, space, and pollution.

We could also get involved in groups that protect, preserve, conserve, and restore nature. By preserving and planting trees, restoring wetlands and prairies, going no-till farming, planting gardens, increasing biodiversity, reducing our carbon footprint, using leaves for compost, helping keep soils absorbent with plenty of worms so there is little run-off and greater groundwater recharge, and keeping development where it exists today.

So much habitat destruction has occurred by converting natural habitats. In contrast, keep what we have and preserve our natural areas. Maybe support a local nonprofit land conservation organization in your area, like [Sycamore Land Trust](https://sycamorelandtrust.org/), which “preserves land, restores habitat, and connects people to nature in southern Indiana” in perpetuity. The more lands we protect from development, the more we will keep our air, water and land clean. Value your relationships with conservation groups, and know that they are helping us every day. Dave Hudak, retired from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and former Sycamore Land Trust board member, talks about “saving the dirt” in the YouTube video below.

Another option is to get involved in a Community Supported Agricultural Farm like [Seton Harvest](https://www.setonharvest.org) which grows all natural produce by farming, hydroponics, and aquaponics. Within its website, an excellent YouTube video says, “soil is a living, breathing organism; in the morning, breathing out; evening, breathing in.”
