**Introduction**

Did you know that mitigation is sometimes required to make up for impacts from highways, wind farms,
development, and other projects? Such mitigation must offset and abate the loss of natural resources, including
endangered/threatened species, and mitigation projects often require a permanent conservation easement with
specific long-term management to ensure their success. Prior to mitigation, though, agencies responsible for
permitting the action must avoid as many impacts as possible, and then minimize impacts.

A most helpful planning tool for avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating is a Geographic Information System to
locate human and natural resources. Mitigation efforts for impacts require different ratios, which need to equal
or be greater than those caused by the project. This means that if an impact to a jurisdictional wetland is 1 acre
and the mitigation ratio is 3:1, then 3 acres of wetland are required. In addition, the mitigation site must be near
the impact site, and it must be approved by environmental regulatory agencies. In some projects, a Preliminary
Mitigation Plan needs to be approved.

Billions of birds and millions of bats have been lost in the last few decades reducing some species to near
extinction, which explains why mitigation properties are so important. For instance, projects that change the
landscape and kill wildlife need to follow prescribed steps given by review agencies, which may include
following the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) or some similar process. The “tipping point” may
apply for such species, where the number gets so low that the species population is in jeopardy.

Prior to 1970, humankind did what it wanted, and often left degraded environments. But today, NEPA requires
an assessment of both human and natural resource impacts prior to approval of a project. Having practiced and
taught mitigation for more than three decades and understanding that there is a functionality required, I realize
that mitigation should not be completed just for the purpose of doing it. It must have meaningful outcomes that
positively contribute to our human and natural environments, e.g., in this article, we’ll focus on protecting
endangered/threatened species along with discussing mitigation sites that provide habitat with a true
replacement value. If the endangered species is a bat, then mitigation could be at a minimum, (1) located within
a recorded maternity colony, (2) have maternity roost tree(s) where females can give birth and rear young or
possibly even have (3) a cave that acts as winter habitat.

If a project kills birds, bats, or impacts other natural resources, regulatory agencies require serious mitigation to
make the replacement useful. We can’t continue to kill wildlife and say, “Oh, we have conservation easements
available to make up for the loss.” This may be true, or it may not, depending upon the requirements in each
permit, which should include at least, yearly mortality numbers from the project and results from any bat
surveys completed at the mitigation site. From experience, the more carefully planned selection of mitigation
sites offers improved and more helpful results, especially in consultation with environmental review agencies
and a third party monitoring them. If you are the monitoring party, know everything about the mitigation
conservation easement, since it is making up for wildlife losses, functions, and values.

## What Can You Do?

1. Follow the 10 Eco-Commandments as given in the presentation “Man and Biosphere,” delivered 3/9/1968
in Paris by Peter Menke-Gluckert to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Peter
Sogaard Jorgensen, 4/29/2014, “Ten Eco-Commandments, Evolution and Sustainability”).

2. Do everything possible to promote the protection of natural habitats.
