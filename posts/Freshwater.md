**Introduction**

Is freshwater important for people and Mother Earth? Yes, freshwater is critical for our survival in
drinking, sanitation, food production, industry, and energy development. All life depends on drinking
freshwater that is safe for our health and well-being. Our human bodies are about 60% water, and it is the
universal solvent in most solutions. Nonetheless, freshwater is being impacted and reduced in availability today
more than most people realize. Please look at the quote from Benjamin Franklin at the end of this article.

For many years, we have reported information from countless reliable sources on many different environmental
issues, which some people appear to reject, are disinterested in, or believe someone else will solve the problem.
We hear quite often as an excuse, &quot;I don’t know what to believe today,&quot; due to AI-generated photos and so
many people making up answers. So let’s be blunt: without freshwater, we simply cannot survive on this
planet, and there is a limited amount of it today. It is said that we are depleting our groundwater and glacial
resources, and, in many cases, polluting our groundwater and surface water resources too. An excellent article
to read on [freshwater resources](https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/groundwater-most-valuable-resource/) is.

As a youngster in Pennsylvania, my sister would ask me to get spring water, which was located about a half a
mile along a road from our home in a wooded area with a small space for parking. Spring water shot out of a
pipe, and it was cold and thirst-quenching. Of course, others got water and drank from this spring too. It was
something we all depended upon, but this spring went dry after a large facility was built near it. Also near our
home, another spring went dry, and another spring was tainted with high salt levels.

Such happenings are common in many states that have mining and oil wells, where today, some people need to
travel many miles to get fresh water to drink, cook, and wash. Some springs and creeks have become so tainted
by mine acid drainage that they’re colored yellow with very low pH levels, and some are devoid of life. Other
freshwater streams have sewage with *Escherichia coli* and other bacteria in them, or possibly even have PCBs
(Polychlorinated Biphenyls) from various sources. And if you live near oil wells, it is not uncommon to open
your kitchen faucet and have colored water that smells like rotten eggs. Do you think these stories say
something? Also, [please review](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/19122025/pennsylvania-oil-and-gas-waste-tracking-logistical-mess/).

For years, the environment has had its freshwater affected by agricultural, industrial, commercial, and
residential use. When we use weed killers, pesticides, or thousands of other man-made “forever chemicals,”
they can run off into nearby streams or enter our groundwater. The medical community has reported that many
carcinogens are present in our drinking water, but we’re told that they are at acceptable levels. Nonetheless,
some of these chemicals can bioaccumulate and cause cancer and other diseases. Remember the [lead poisoning
in Flint, Michigan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59243426). Do we want this for our children
or us?

**What Can You Do?**

It is imperative that we have a “change of mind” in regards to our freshwater and what we do with our wastes.
Our freshwater must be protected **from all harm** and be of a quality suitable for people to drink. One person
presented the thought about people having better water by simply working with water companies and
paying more. Maybe they can upgrade their wastewater treatment plants with more money, which, in turn, can
make our drinking water better.

We know no one wants to pay more, but if we want better water, we need to value our water more. So let’s try
to use less water, and filter it. Drink from glass, not plastic, and report any violations you see to appropriate
governmental agencies. For instance, if you find people dumping, report it. The perpetrators need to be held
accountable, and with enforcement, we’ll get better water, cleaner air, and safer environments. Those that affect
our freshwater pose a threat to us all. Let’s change our current trend heading in the wrong direction and look to
cleaner days through enforcement and working with others more effectively. Please review the short YouTube
