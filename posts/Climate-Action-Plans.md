**Introduction**

Do you know if your country/state/city has a Climate Action Plan (CAP)? A CAP is a detailed document for
[measuring, planning, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in an effort to solve climatic impacts.](https://www.burlingtonvt.gov/Sustainability/CAP) [In June 2024, more than 20 federal agencies released updated CAPs](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/06/20/usda-releases-updated-climate-adaptation-and-resilience-plan), while Tracy Wholf reported since March
2024 in the United States, 45 states had CAPs. ClimateCheck said, [“Hundreds of cities across the United States are using CAPs to guide their climate change response by guiding government and community actions”.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-action-plan-states-emissions/)

In communication with the Evansville Climate Collaborative per Director Lauren Norvell, “Indiana just
completed the first ever state primary CAP, and will have a comprehensive CAP completed by this time next
year.” She also said, “many Indiana cities have CAPs of which is now the norm and expectation.” In 2021,
Evansville, Indiana published its [Climate Action Plan](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEB-L8w4EQ/mhIqWKdtTgSAZqksJjnwHA/view?utm_content=DAEB-L8w4EQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer) with support from the Environmental Resilience Institute
of Indiana University. Evansville’s CAP focused on: (1) Transportation; (2) Building and Energy; (3) Waste;
and (4) Local Food, Agriculture, and Green Space. It’s currently being revised to be published in 2025.

The Evansville Climate Collaborative also reported, “the proposed Evansville CAP will focus on strategies that
can be implemented, and that have direct and measurable impact on GHG reductions. It will focus on things
Evansville residents, businesses, organizations, and the municipality can do. We must start at home and show
some success in reducing emissions, and then we can dream big and lead an attempt at a regional CAP in the
future.”

Other thoughts for CAPs may include transportation, infrastructure, refuges, or urban planning projects. Any
time a CAP can promote more green space, it acts as a carbon sink, cools nearby municipalities by its vegetated
wetlands/forests, and serves as a buffer for storms. Some CAPs may even support community-supported
agriculture farms that feed the hungry and poor. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services even
recommends [Occupancy Emergency Plans, including shelter-in-place and evacuation guidance, for extreme event responses.](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/hhs-climate-action-plan-9-28-2021.pdf)

In addition, it is not uncommon for a CAP to support more solar panels, green roofs, tree plantings, and
permeable surfaces. These actions help reduce the city as a “heat sink.” CAPs could even include recycling of
wastes, e.g., plastic. For more information on reducing plastic, please visit https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/ .

## **What Can You Do?**

Transportation - Work from home, carpool/combine trips/public transport, bike, walk, or buy an electric car.

Building and Energy - Assess your property’s carbon footprint; make your home well-sealed, insulated, and
weatherized; install low-flow toilets, shower heads, and faucets; unplug electronic devices when not in use; and
include planting in downtown areas [cascading green plants like those used in Chinese apartment buildings.](https://www.google.com/search?q=Cascading+Green+plant+designs+downtown+in+China)

Waste - Reduce, reuse, recycle, repurpose, repair, and refuse; compost yard/home wastes; shop in bulk; use
reusable bottles/grocery bags; do not use straws; choose seasonal/local produce; use 100% cotton, not polyester
or nylon; and use water collected in rain barrels for irrigating gardens and yards during droughts.

Local Food, Agriculture, and Green Space - Shop locally; consider a plant-rich diet; garden at home; join
Master Gardeners; protect refuges, parks, and conservation areas; make your property park-like; and promote
farming methods that keep roots in the soil year-round. For no-till farming, please read Frank Lessiter’s book
_“Frankly Speaking: A Non-Whitewashed, &#39;First-Hand&#39; Account of No-Till Farming&#39;s Rise Over 50-Plus Years.”_
