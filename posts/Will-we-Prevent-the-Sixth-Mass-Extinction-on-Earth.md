**Introduction**

Do you know what former [Vice President Al Gore said about how we can stop climate change?](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/24/al-gore-climate-change-00133166) “We can do
this,” he said, “if we just overcome the greed and political power of the big fossil fuel polluters who have been
trying to control this process. It’s time for people at the grassroots level in every country to speak up, and the
good news is, that’s happening too.” To hear him, please visit the YouTube video, a link provided near the end
of this article.

Did you know in 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Albert Arnold (Al) Gore Jr. shared the
Nobel Peace Prize?” Also, read about what [Earth Day 2000 said on the environmental accomplishments
between 1993 to 2000.](https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/CEQ/earthday/ch13.html)

For the last few decades, Gore and others have warned us about climate change. However, if we do not quickly
change to renewable energy forms, we will cause the **sixth mass extinction on Earth WITH US GOING
EXTINCT**. David Wallace-Wells in his book “The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming” (2020) reports
the first four mass extinctions were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gases, while the one
mass extinction of dinosaurs was caused by a meteor.

The most notorious extinction was 250 million years ago, when carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub> ) warmed the planet 5º C.
Currently, we have raised the CO<sub>2</sub> level in the atmosphere to 427 ppm as of June 22, 2024. And according to
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, [“Earth was about 1.36º C warmer in 2023 than in the late 19th-
century average…The ten most recent years have been the warmest years on record.](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/?intent=121) ” AGU Publications warn,
[“Future mass extinction can be stopped only by cutting human emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> to zero, optimally by 2% per
year starting now.”](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022EF003336)

## What Can You Do?

Listen to Gore and other scientists about what they say on climate change, and vote for leaders who will care
about this planet, and its citizens. Our message needs to be clear, that we have no other choice than to go **net
zero** in our greenhouse gas emissions **NOW**, and work to reduce such emissions more.

Work also with organizations that will protect our natural resources, e.g., support the Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) and their “[Once-in-a-Lifetime” Investment in No-Till Farming](https://www.no-tillfarmer.com/articles/12271-nrcs-making-once-in-a-lifetime-investment-in-no-till), that said, “The
Inflation Reduction Act, passed August 16, 2022, designates $20 billion for the NRCS. Another $2.8 billion
will come from the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, a USDA program that finances pilot
projects supporting the production and marketing of climate-smart commodities.”

Today, **“CARBON SINKS”** are needed to store carbon in the ground. Prime examples are regenerative (e.g.,
no-till farming with cover crops), and preserving/planting forests, grasslands, and wetlands. Concurrently, stop
burning fossil fuels and global warming which is causing sea level rise. Icebergs/glaciers and tundra (including
its permafrost) are so important. Also, please listen to [Al Gore](https://www.cnn.com/videos/weather/2023/12/24/al-gore-climate-jake-tapper-sot-sotu-vpx.cnn) on efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

Story: When Bill Clinton and Al Gore campaigned, my wife and three young children were up front in the
crowd. When Al Gore saw people pushing my children, he stopped them. Thank you, Al, for being you!
