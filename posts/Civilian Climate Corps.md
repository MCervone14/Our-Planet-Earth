**Introduction**

Do you know that as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic climate agenda, the American Civilian
Climate Corps (CCC) was established on September 20, 2023, where more than 20,000 Americans will
conserve and restore our land, air and water, and make our communities more climate resilient? It is a
workforce to help young people gain access to training necessary for good-paying careers in clean energy and in
the climate field. [It’s mission is to engage young people and veterans in activities to help and make better the
health, diversity, and productivity of our public lands.](https://www.blm.gov/careers/students-and-grads/civilian-climate-corps)

The CCC will also address and promote clean energy, implement energy efficient technologies, and advance
environmental justice. [All of these benefits will create high-quality, good-paying clean energy and climate
resilience jobs in the public and private sectors after participants complete their paid training program.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/21/what-they-are-saying-biden-harris-administration-launches-american-climate-corps/)

In addition, this program will provide employment and education for people ages 16-30 (and returning veterans
up to the age of 35) in natural and cultural resource conservation, professional development, and scientific
studies by using the Public Land Corps Act (PLCA) of 1993. [It will also attract and recruit entry-level
employees to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) within two years of completing their 640 hours of
creditable service.](https://www.blm.gov/careers/students-and-grads/civilian-climate-corps) Consistent with President Biden’s call for Congress to increase the AmeriCorps living
allowance, [CCC members will receive a compensation package equivalent to $15 an hour, including lodging,
transportation, clothing, a living allowance, health benefits, and much more. No prior education or experience
will be required.](https://americorps.gov/newsroom/press-release/president-biden-launches-american-climate-corps-announces-new-americorps)

To help lift the United States out of the Great Depression in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established
the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to improve America’s public lands, forests, and parks. Now in 2023, we
have the Civilian Climate Corps so young people can work toward sustaining natural resources in communities
and state and national parks, while enhancing their professional, educational, and personal goals. They will also
build a strong foundation for starting their career, which will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Similarly,
[veterans often find it a pathway to careers](https://ccc.ca.gov/how-to-join/frequently-asked-questions/) in firefighting, transportation departments and in fish and wildlife
departments concurrent with giving opportunities to see beautiful and unique places, create lifelong memories,
and form lasting relationships with fellow Corps members.

**What Can You Do?**

If interested, [there are many credited U.S. youth corps in the United States](https://corpsnetwork.org/find-a-corps) , e.g., [Minnesotta and Iowa.](https://corpsnetwork.org/organizations/conservation-corps-minnesota-iowa/) A youth
corps is a locally based organization whose goal is to help young adults and veterans in meaningful service
projects and in the development of environmental stewardship. Service terms can range from a few months to a
year. During this time, Corps members not only gain significant work experience, but also have access to
mentoring and career counseling among other benefits. It also connects the BLM with youth corps and other
organizations to provide conservation work and training opportunities. [For additional information about “How
to Get Involved” in Youth Engagement Programs or the Civilian Climate Corps, please go to this website.](https://www.blm.gov/careers/students-and-grads/civilian-climate-corps)
