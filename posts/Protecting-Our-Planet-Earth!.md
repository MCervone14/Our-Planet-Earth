**Introduction**

Do you believe in climate change? [The National Aeronautics and Space Administration says, the rate of change
since the mid-20th century is unprecedented over millennia](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/). Please see graph above. [On June 8, 2024, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> level was 427.02 ppm](https://www.co2.earth/daily-co2).

[People do care about climate change](https://ourworldindata.org/climate-change-support) and the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health) says:

- Climate change is contributing to humanitarian emergencies from heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical
  storms and hurricanes which are increasing in scale, frequency and intensity.

- Research shows that 3.6 billion people live in highly susceptible areas to climate change, and between
  2030-2050, climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year.

[The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide) causes climate change. [Even though CO<sub>2</sub>](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/there-place-atmosphere-where-carbon-dioxide-concentrated-and-if-so-can-we-remove-it) mixes evenly through the
atmosphere, it is most dense near the ground . By polluting the planet and changing global temperatures, we’re
melting ice at the poles, causing sea level rise, and we’ve awakened a sleeping giant, the permafrost. The
[permafrost](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/permafrost-thaw-warming-world-arctic-institute-permafrost-series-fall-winter-2020/) covers 24% of the surface of land masses in the northern hemisphere and accounts for nearly half of
all organic carbon stored within the planet’s soil.

With the permafrost melting, microbes increase and release, through decomposition, greenhouse gases (e.g.,
methane and CO<sub>2</sub> ). These gases are heat absorbing molecules in the atmosphere that cause a greenhouse effect.
To make matters worse, we’re cutting down more forests, burning fossil fuels, and not keeping our lands green.
**Protecting _Our Planet Earth_ is critically important for all generations!**

##What Can You Do?

You can make a difference by reading, practicing, and incorporating ways to reduce climate change. To do so,
this article focuses on four authors.

**Diana Ensign, JD, award-winning Indiana author**, offers practical Earth care solutions in her new book,
Faith, Hope, Action: Ushering In A New Earth Era, Together (2024). Her book is comprehensive and provides
numerous ways to make our Mother Earth healthy. Faith, Hope, Action is not only enjoyable, it also teaches us
much about making this world a better place to live. Visit her website at www.dianaensign.com.

**Julie Peller, Ph.D.** writes a weekly column called Green Junction for Holy Martyrs and Our Lady of
Consolation Parishes in Merrillville, Indiana. She reports on many different environmental issues. Being a
chemist from Valparaiso University, she has a special interest in micro and nano plastics. Her email is
julierpel@gmail.com , and you can send her an email to receive her weekly column.

**Tom Cervone, Ph.D.** writes articles meant to encourage, inspire, and inform
citizens to act now, and practice ecological principles. Our Planet Earth is linked with the websites: Laudato Si’
Action Platform and ArchIndy Care for Creation. Principles offered compliment Pope Francis’ _Laudato Si’_.

[**Molly Burhans**, founder and executive director of Goodlands](https://good-lands.org/) , is fighting climate change too. [She with others are mapping 177 million acres owned by the Catholic Church in the world](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/22/1074262/cartographer-fights-climate-change), and making the Church’s land work for good.

_Tom Cervone, Ph.D. is a deacon and ecologist in Evansville, Indiana. He graduated from St. Bonaventure, a
Franciscan University. Sister Maureen Houlihan D.C. is a member of the “Care of Earth” Committee - St.
Louise Province of the Daughters of Charity USA and member of Seton Harvest Farm, a Community Supported
Agriculture Farm that grows all natural produce for shareholders and the poor. Nicole Cervone-Gish, Ed. MS.
is an English Language Learner teacher, who lives in Evansville, Indiana with her family, and teaches at Holy
Spirit Catholic School. Michael Cervone, BS. is a designer of websites who also lives in Evansville, Indiana.
