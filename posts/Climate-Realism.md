**Introduction**

In today’s age, many of us have heard the term “climate realism” rather than “climate change.” Tenets of
climate realism emphasize that people need to prepare for inevitable warming, prioritize our adaptation and
resilience, and in preparation, advance our national interests, and rethink our global cooperation.

At the end of this article, climate realism is strongly criticized by our former vice president, Al Gore. Criticism
comes from our being doomed to fail; the risks of wealthy nations taking advantage of developing nations;
delays in our current positive efforts; and it does not address the mitigation of 1-2 billion refugees by 2050.

Considering all the great things that have happened in converting our energy from non-renewable to renewable,
it would seem counterproductive to stop now unless there are other considerations. One such consideration may
be that lobbyists for fossil fuel companies want the burning of fossil fuels. It may also deal with corporate
agendas, projected quotas, and getting the most now before any nonrenewable energy sources vanish.

Should a few people and a few companies gain monetary wealth at the expense of killing the planet? Yes, they
offer carefully prepared speeches and present sound bites that simply distract everyone into thinking we cannot
do something that we’re already doing quite well now. We’re doing such amazing things, and we will continue
to do them into the future if we have the leadership. For instance, where is the Inflation Reduction Act that put
billions of dollars into helping save the planet? Where are we with our NATO allies and the Paris Agreement?
Could not the Montreal Protocol be a guide for us? Is the current administration requiring NASA to remove two
satellites that monitor carbon dioxide levels on Earth, and if so, WHY?

We do know that we cannot continue to use our atmosphere and oceans as open sewers, including the
decimation of our forests, especially rain forests. You’ve heard these words for many decades, but there’s really
an urgency now to save this planet. Dr. Margaret Chan, the former World Health Organization Director-
General, said, “**Climate change is the greatest global health threat of the 21 st century**.”

So do not fall for the distraction by climate realists, which will only exacerbate the situation to a point
of no return. We do not want to give up on our planet and its people, many of whom are our loved ones
who have illnesses that air, water, and land pollution will only worsen. Our global surface temperatures
have increased because of greenhouse effects (see chart above) and they must be lowered for us to
survive during this very important time in our planet’s history. **Our lives depend upon reducing
carbon emissions** and getting the temperatures down. We simply wish to reduce the burning of non-renewable energy sources! Accepting climate realism is a giving-up response, and an easy wrong.

**What Can You Do?**

To combat climate realism, we should advocate for aggressive climate change mitigation efforts. We need to
transition to renewable energy like solar and wind and work for more efficiency in transportation and in our
homes. By consuming less energy and fewer products and supporting policies that reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, we can gain ground and reverse current trends.

We can also support organizations and initiatives that are focused on transitioning to more sustainable
economies and learn from other countries like Switzerland. They currently are experimenting with solar panels
placed between railroad tracks that generate electricity, combined with their continued use as existing rail lines.

On the individual level, we can combat climate realism by recycling, reusing, traveling less, reducing our
consumption, walking and bicycling, eating locally grown foods, making our homes more energy-efficient,
using less water, and addressing plastic pollution. At the same time, we can promote green efforts to grow food,
plant trees, and curb any excess waste, along with reducing urban sprawl and significantly reducing non-permeable surfaces.

Quote: In a November 2019 speech, former Vice President Al Gore said, “…for anyone who
thinks we do not, as human beings, have the political will to bring about the necessary changes,
please remember that political will is itself a renewable resource.”
