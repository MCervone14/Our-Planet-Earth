**Introduction**

Did you know celebrating September 1 as a Day of Prayer for Creation begins the Season of Creation? The
season goes through October 4, the Feast Day of St. Francis of Assisi. It is an annual celebration uniting
everyone in prayer and action for the protection of our common home.

The Most Reverend Paul Etienne, Archbishop of Seattle, says, “Let the Lord move us to recognize where we
are being called to personal conversion in our relationship with God, the human family, and creation. Then,
pray about what we can personally do to show our compassion for healing some part of God’s creation.”

Three compassionate ways addressed in this article are:

1. conversion to renewable forms of energy
2. no-till farming
3. conservation of wetlands, forests, and prairies

It is a well-known fact that greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) are heating up the atmosphere
and planet, and causing a climate crisis shown by melting of the poles/icebergs and permafrost, rising sea level,
and many wildfires with extended flooding and/or droughts throughout the world. The sooner we move to
renewable energy forms, the sooner we’ll be able to reduce and hopefully avoid a climatic crisis.

No-till farming is good for the Earth and all life. It reduces the use of fossil fuel-powered machinery and retains
carbon in the soil rather than releasing greenhouse gases during tillage. Since [no-till farming doesn’t require a
tractor to pull a plow, it saves fuel, cutting emissions. Estimates across the nation report no-till farming
saves 588 million gallons of diesel fuel annually which is enough energy to power over 720,000 homes per
year, and prevents at least 5.8 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the equivalent of removing 1 million cars off the road”](https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/no-till-farming-improves-soil-health-and-mitigates-climate-change). No-till farming increases our food securities, reduces flooding, and loss of chemicals by water and wind erosion. It makes the soil less compact, yet holds water like a sponge, and develops healthy topsoil with many
macro- and microorganisms. It costs less, requires less time, and gives greater production.

The conservation of wetlands, forests, and prairies are also needed to protect wildlife, plants, and humans. By
having such habitats, rainwater is held and the groundwater recharged, thus reducing flooding, erosion of stream
banks, and run-off of chemicals into larger water bodies downstream. It does no one any good to fertilize and
deposit sediments in the ocean, especially with their warmer waters holding less oxygen now. [The largest dead
zone in the ocean lies in the Arabian Sea, while the second largest sits in the Gulf of Mexico](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/dead-zones). According to the United Nations Development Program (December 2015), “Worldwide there are now more than 500 ‘dead
zones’ which are doubling every ten years since the 1960s. The economic costs to fisheries, tourism and other
coastal livelihoods cost billions per year.”

## **What Can You Do?**

**Convert to renewable forms of energy** - Support solar, geothermal, wind and hydroelectric. Live a simpler life
by using less energy at home and in traveling locally or abroad.

**No-till farming** - Shop locally and tell others that we appreciate all the efforts farmers give, especially in no-till
farming and bringing back rich topsoil, earthworms, and other valuable critters that live in the soil.

**Conservation of wetlands, forests, and prairies** - Support these measures since they help keep our air, water,
and land clean. If you own property, plant trees and make your property park-like. Planting trees make a great
memorial or celebration for a person, e.g., Arbor Day Foundation plants trees for such times.
