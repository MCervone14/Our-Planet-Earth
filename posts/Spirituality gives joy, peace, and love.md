## Introduction

Do you know that joy and peace come from when we spiritually care for and love others besides ourselves? Our
greatest joys are when we help people, and by doing so, we help ourselves. One definition of spirituality is: [“a
process of making the mind face our fears, worries, and non-stop thinking, and experiencing inner peace and
bliss in one’s everyday life”](https://www.successconsciousness.com/blog/spirituality/what-is-spirituality-meaning-and-definition/). Spirituality is about making peace with the universe , and accepting facts as they are
and trying to live in harmony. Great examples of spirituality are Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dalai
Lama, and Nelson Mandela.

It does no good to isolate ourselves and treat others as outsiders. Being judgemental is simply wrong since we
live in a world with so many exciting people. Two excellent examples of inclusivity are Martin Luther King, Jr.
and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who spent their entire careers promoting justice and reconciliation for all.
The world is global, and people are moving from one country to another creating more of a mixture of all
different types of people. It is our hope that newcomers will be accepted for who they are because spiritually, it
will make each and every one of us happier. Having family and friends does not mean you shouldn’t meet and
make new friends. Loving others will expand our horizons in learning, caring, and loving all people, and by
doing this, we will receive joy, peace, and love.

[On October 27 of 1986, representatives of various Christian denominations and world religions came at the
invitation of Pope John Paul II to Assisi, the city of St Francis. They were united by a common goal — the
desire for peace](https://slmedia.org/blog/jp-ii-we-love-you-pope-john-paul-ii-embraced-by-buddhist-monk).

## What Can You Do?

**Be More Open-Minded** - People throughout the world are different in many regards, but learning more about
their language, culture, cuisine, and religion can be rewarding in so many ways. Our mindset needs to be
welcoming, and not judgemental, and we cannot always think we’re right and everyone else is wrong.

**Give Food, Clothing, Water, and Education** - We can give these resources by funding charities so others can
tend livestock, grow crops, and live sustainably. We can also help people who are hungry and helpless,
regardless of their religion, race, or age, by helping at soup kitchens, food banks, or rescue missions.

**Work for All to have a Home** - Homelessness is a travesty of justice and commonly seen in many
communities. Let’s work with city governments to help get people into homes that they can call their own.
Everyone needs a safe, warm, and peaceful place to live.

**Show Charity** - To love others, we need to go out to them and show them we care and that we are willing to
help them. This includes many things, but the most important is being there for them and having reasonable
choices and expectations open for their needs. We need to reach out to people early in the process before
desperation sets in for them, which can open them to even more vulnerability and abuse.
