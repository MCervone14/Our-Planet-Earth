# **Introduction**

We are so pleased that Pope Francis and Pope Leo XIV opened Borgo Laudato Si’ to the public. It acts as a new
ecological center with the historic Papal Villas of Castel Gandolfo, a summer residence for popes. The size of
the property is about 135 acres, located 15-18 miles south of Rome, Italy. The center promotes Pope Francis’s
teaching in integral ecology through sustainable farming, vocational training, and environmental education.
Borgo in Italian means village, hamlet, or borough.

Pope Leo XVI had an inaugural ceremony at Borgo Laudato Si‘ on September 5, 2025 which included a Liturgy
of the Word on Care for Creation, a homily emphasizing humanity’s role as “custodians” of creation, and
musical performances by Andrea Bocelli and his son Mateo. It featured greenhouses, farmland, and gardens, all
powered by renewable energy to teach and promote ecological stewardship. The Pope blessed animals and land,
highlighting the concept of “integral ecology,” which connects care for the environment with care for people.

Borgo Laudato Si’ is accessible to everyone, including students, religious communities, business leaders, and
the vulnerable, and it represents a future vision for the Catholic Church. Carol Glatz reported on this property
on September 5, 2025 in [“Pope inaugurates center, farm dedicated to zero waste, inclusive economy”](https://www.usccb.org/news/2025/pope-inaugurates-center-farm-dedicated-zero-waste-inclusive-economy).

The center embodies the vision of Pope Francis, first conceived in 2023, and is intended to continue his legacy
of environmental stewardship. There are over 3,000 Catholic dioceses worldwide, with recent estimates placing
the number at about 3,172 ecclesiastical jurisdictions as of mid-2024. This number includes dioceses and
archdioceses and is an estimate that includes over 652 archdioceses and about 2,250 dioceses. The Dicastery for
Promoting Integral Human Development which also includes the Laudato Si’ Action Platform, reported in their
[2024 Annual Report](https://laudatosiactionplatform.org/read-the-2024-annual-report/) 4,904 institutions and
5,156 families and individuals registered, broken down into:

&#x2713; 1,161 Schools <br/>
&#x2713; 955 Organizational Groups<br/>
&#x2713; 726 Congregations <br/> 
&#x2713; 668 Religious Communities <br/> 
&#x2713; 581 Parishes <br/> 
&#x2713; 257 Universities <br/> 
&#x2713; 240 Dioceses <br/> 
&#x2713; 159 Health and Healing <br/> 
&#x2713; 104 Economic Entities <br/> 

The center will act to evangelize people in and beyond the Church, calling them to a spiritual “ecological
conversion” and a renewed relationship with God and creation. Using environmental care as a moral issue

rooted in a deep faith perspective, it aims to engage greater global importance and make the Church’s message
relevant to contemporary challenges. It grounds faith in action, encouraging a lifestyle of care for the
environment as a form of discipleship and a way to encounter God.

It is a beautiful property where humankind can act in evangelizing ecology by using sustainable measures such
as renewable energy, living off the land, and coexisting with nature. Crops will be grown along with raising
livestock, which will allow, in 2026, a restaurant to be opened by a chef and owner from Chicago, Illinois.
Meals will be served from what is grown on the property. Also, the University of Notre Dame offers at the
center a 1 credit course in environmental studies.

Borgo Laudato Si’ is a wonderful opportunity to show the world how we can live in harmony with nature. It’s
our way of practically working on aspects to be sustainable. This property will offer humankind the ability to
act upon what will make this world better, and having Pope Leo spearhead this effort is truly remarkable.
It’s been 10 years since Pope Francis published Laudato Si’, and even today many people have not accepted his
words of caring for creation, and many people have done little to follow sustainable ways of living. This
educational center will be a shining and practical way of showing how things can work, and maybe it
will be an example of how the rest of the world can be. We pray that it may jump-start others into what
is possible, and that we bring God back everywhere into our lives.

## **What Can You Do?**

Learn more about Borgo Laudato Si’ and try to emulate its successes. Maybe we will learn how to live without
plastics, be more efficient in using products that are biodegradable, or grow crops with organic soil made from
compost. Bee hives may be constructed and honey procured along with creating even more flower gardens for
pollinators, birds, and wildlife. Rainwater too could be captured and used for irrigation and drinking. Similarly
and most importantly, most of the land will be permeable and maintain quality air and water standards.
