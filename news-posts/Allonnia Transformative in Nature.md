'The waste problem is a vast and growing problem, and impacts the health of our planet and
everyone,” says Nicole Richards, CEO of Allonnia. What’s exciting about this company is its
mission to facilitate a waste-free, pollution-free environment. Allonnia copies natural processes
to recycle wastes. It uses enzymes, proteins and/or microbes to break down contaminants,
rendering them inert or binding valuable elements such as metals and plastics for upcycling.
Nature already contains the “ingredients” to do this work, but it takes time. Allonnia takes these
ingredients and improves them so the process is done quickly and efficiently.'"
