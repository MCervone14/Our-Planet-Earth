The NEPA has been a blessing for 50 years because it requires projects to realize their impacts on the environment, and be held accountable. It was developed to avoid, minimize, and mitigate/lessen our impacts upon Earth’s air, water and soil.","cover_image":"/images/posts/A Team Effort of Love.jpg"}},{"slug":"Bees, butterflies and earthworms","frontmatter":{"title":"Bees, Butterflies and Earthworms","date":"2022-01-28","excerpt":"In 1963, Peter, Paul and Mary (an American folk group) released their version of the Bob Dylan song “Blowin’ in the Wind.” In it, they sing, “Where have all the flowers gone?” Today, these lyrics could easily become, “Where have all the bees, butterflies and earthworms gone?” These animals may be considered sentinel species used to detect risks to humans, very much like a canary sent into a coal mine. If it died, that was an early warning.","cover_image":"/images/posts/Bees, butterflies and earthworms.jpg"}},{"slug":"Can we cool the Earth","frontmatter":{"title":"Can We Cool the Earth?","date":"2022-09-30","excerpt":"Did you know the TV show “Highway to Heaven” produced many episodes about the environment? Merry Christmas from Grandpa (1989; Season 5/Episode 13) aired 33 years ago. It’s significant because many issues then －exist today. Similarly, Katharine Hayhoe, Ph.D., had a great video entitled “The most important thing you can do to fight climate change” (12/14/18).","cover_image":"/images/posts/Can we cool the Earth.jpg"}},{"slug":"Carbon Neutrality","frontmatter":{"title":"Carbon Neutrality","date":"2022-03-18","excerpt":"The majority of greenhouse gases in the United States, like carbon dioxide, come from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). They cause climate change by trapping heat, and have far-ranging environmental and health effects (National Geographic, Carbon dioxide levels are at a record high. Here’s what you need to know.

Maybe a blue sky with drifting white clouds and sunlight striking (heating) the Earth? It’s so glorious and vast from Earth; but from space, it’s so very thin. Do you know it’s our atmosphere that contains oxygen for us to breathe, and it is our security blanket protecting us from ultraviolet rays? If we had no atmosphere, there would be no life. The atmosphere even allows us to hear.","cover_image":"/images/posts/Earth’s atmosphere.jpg"}},{"slug":"Global warming and climate change","frontmatter":{"title":"Global Warming and Climate Change","date":"2021-09-17","excerpt":"In previous articles, we’ve highlighted Pope Francis’ efforts in “Laudato Si’” and discussed many ecological principles.

In the U.S. Midwest, they’re called prairies; in South America, pampas; in Central Eurasia, steppes; and in Africa, savannas. What they all have in common are perennial, bunch grasses (little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass) and wildflowers (milkweed, coneflowers, sunflowers).","cover_image":"/images/posts/Grasslands, pollinators, and our health.jpg"}},{"slug":"Healthy soils reduce flooding, global warming and run-off","frontmatter":{"title":"Healthy Soils Reduce Flooding, Global Warming and Run-off","date":"2021-07-30","excerpt":" Did you know that, through years of soil degradation, nitrogen, phosphorus and sediments have run off into rivers that enter the Mississippi River creating a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico the size of New Jersey (The Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone - SERC – Carleton, 10/15/2019)?","cover_image":"/images/posts/Healthy soils reduce flooding, global warming and run-off.jpg"}},{"slug":"Oceans, coastlines and the Great Lakes","frontmatter":{"title":"Oceans, Coastlines and the Great Lakes","date":"2022-02-18","excerpt":"Did you know the that U.S. Department of the Interior protects coastlines for the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Gulf of Mexico, and our five Great Lakes? Lake Michigan touches 45 miles of Indiana coastline, including Indiana Dunes National Park. It was authorized by Congress in 1966 as the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and re-designated as the nation&#39;s 61st National Park Feb 15, 2019. Oceans, coastlines and the Great Lakes need protection because they are God’s gifts for our enjoyment and survival, and they affect people throughout the world.","cover_image":"/images/posts/Oceans, coastlines and the Great Lakes.jpg"}},{"slug":"Pollution, Waste and a Throwaway Culture","frontmatter":{"title":"Pollution, Waste and a Throwaway Culture","date":"2021-01-22","excerpt":" Did you know air pollutants can cause health problems like cancer, and change the Earth’s climate too? For instance, greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide absorb heat, and increase air and ocean temperatures resulting in global warming. It is global warming ― warmer temperatures, melting glaciers, and increasing sea levels ― that causes climate change, which forces people and animals from their homes.","cover_image":"/images/posts/Pollution, Waste and a Throwaway Culture.jpg"}},{"slug":"Pope Francis calls us to action on ecological issues","frontmatter":{"title":"Pope Francis Calls Us to Action on Ecological Issues","date":"2021-05-14","excerpt":" Did you know that, on May 24, 2015, Pope Francis signed an encyclical called “Laudato Si’ – On Care for our Common Home?” Five years later, he announced an Anniversary Year from May 24, 2020, to May 24, 2021, where he encourages a new way of living.

An excellent article is, “The Soil is Alive, Protecting Soil Biodiversity across Europe” (European Commission, 5/22/08). Soils with high biodiversity can be noisy (Ute Eberle, 2/9/22, Life in the soil was thought to be silent. What if it isn’t? Living World). Franklin D.
