One definition of spirituality is: “a process of making the mind face our fears, worries, and non-stop thinking, and experiencing inner peace and bliss in one’s everyday life”. Spirituality is about making peace with the universe, and accepting facts as they are and trying to live in harmony. Great examples of spirituality are Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dalai Lama, and Nelson Mandela.","category":"Ecological-Spirituality","cover_image":"/images/posts/Spirituality gives joy, peace, and love.jpg","lat_lng":[43.0707,-12.6196],"news_category":"Our Planet Earth Article"}},{"slug":"Spirituality","frontmatter":{"title":"Spirituality","date":"2023-12-18","excerpt":"Did you know spirituality involves the recognition or feeling or belief that there is something greater than yourself, something more to being human than a sensory experience?
