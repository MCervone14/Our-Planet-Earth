The NEPA has been a blessing for 50 years because it requires projects to realize their impacts on the environment, and be held accountable. It was developed to avoid, minimize, and mitigate/lessen our impacts upon Earth’s air, water and soil.","category":"Ecological Education","cover_image":"/images/posts/A Team Effort of Love.jpg"}},{"slug":"Bees, butterflies and earthworms","frontmatter":{"title":"Bees, Butterflies and Earthworms","date":"2022-01-28","excerpt":"In 1963, Peter, Paul and Mary (an American folk group) released their version of the Bob Dylan song “Blowin’ in the Wind.” In it, they sing, “Where have all the flowers gone?” Today, these lyrics could easily become, “Where have all the bees, butterflies and earthworms gone?” These animals may be considered sentinel species used to detect risks to humans, very much like a canary sent into a coal mine.

Maybe a blue sky with drifting white clouds and sunlight striking (heating) the Earth? It’s so glorious and vast from Earth; but from space, it’s so very thin. Do you know it’s our atmosphere that contains oxygen for us to breathe, and it is our security blanket protecting us from ultraviolet rays? If we had no atmosphere, there would be no life.

An excellent article is, “The Soil is Alive, Protecting Soil Biodiversity across Europe” (European Commission, 5/22/08). Soils with high biodiversity can be noisy (Ute Eberle, 2/9/22, Life in the soil was thought to be silent. What if it isn’t? Living World). Franklin D.
